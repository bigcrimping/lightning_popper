## Project Code

The code is here: https://github.com/bigcrimping/lightning_popper/tree/main/lightning_code

You will need to add the "Soldered AS3935 Lightning sensor library" and the "Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040" board package to compile

## Wiring

The base contains:
1) Raspberry Pi Pico
2) SparkFun AS3935 Lightning Detector
3) Generic LDO board (to feed AS3935 supply)
4) "L298N DC Motor Driver MX1508 Mini Dual Channel 1.5A"
5) "HW-432" Step up converter(6V)

Wiring is as below:
